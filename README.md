## 5. Recommendations

### Short Life Cycle of Products

* Short life cycle limits the supply, leading to the price rise.
* Highly set product price in the second-hand market would affect the release price. 

### More Effective and Efficient Advertisement

* Nearly 13 million users has liked Lego's Facebook page.
* The 'likes' of each advertisement posting is comparatively very low.
* The advertisements are not regarded relevant to the viewers. 

### Reduction in the Licensed Sets

* Licensing is the major factor for the pricing.
* Reducing the liscensed set would help to lower the price.

### More Sales
* Lego needs to roll out more sales promotions which are comparatively weak than its competitors such as Sonogong and Oxford.
